## Project

#### Challenge

#### Sprint Backlog
The sprint backlog is one of the three artifacts in a SCRUM project. It is a listing of the tasks to be done within a sprint. They were self-organized by the development team and drawn from the product backlog or created from the current sprint goal.
+ Here you can find our current [Sprint Backlog](https://gitlab.rlp.net/top/21s/slc/MUTE/-/boards/1543).
#### Product Backlog
The product backlog contains all the requirements for the product and the quality of the product backlog is crucial for the successful completion of a project. As the product owner evolves the list of requirements, the product backlog is a dynamic list. The Product Backlog is maintained during the entire project duration. The requirements are processed step by step in sprints.
